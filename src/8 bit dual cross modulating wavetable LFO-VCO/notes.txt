Use arduino 8bit pwm output with rc filter as cheap ADC.

common sync/tap tempo
common pot for coarse frequency
cv control of coarse frequency (1v/o + lin/exp = 2 jacks, 1 att, 1 switch lin/exp)
mix out 
min out
max out
difference out
ringmod out (digital, no inputs)

2 osc with cross modulation
each osc have:
1 pot for detune/fine frequency
cv control of detune/fine frequency (1 jack, 1 att)
1 out with selectable waveform
1 pot to select waveform
cv control of waveform select (1 jack, pot above act att)
1 pot to waveshape 
cv control of waveshape (1 jack, pot above act att)
1 pot for clock/sync divide/mult
cv control of div/mult (1 jack, pot above act att)
1 pot for fm amount from the other osc
cv control of fm amount (1 jack, pot above act att)
clock out 50% duty cycle
