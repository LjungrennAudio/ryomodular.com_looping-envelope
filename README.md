this is just a part of the greater wonder that i hope will still prove to be the mathcing set of 5 that i did name bu forgort the name of... doh!

this is the envelope/lfo optionality of the set - a string of 4 'envelopes' that can loopmto ecome lfos, be chained to form way greater env's/lfos or even be set to do weird shid like doing one shot stuff.

i dunno how quite to approach the concept of a set of 5 matching  modules tat all need to be released at once and cope well so i'm nto thinking baoutit. i'llget there when i'm a little more settled back on the unridden for so long horse.
